# VISION - A VOICE ASSISTANT

This android app made using kotlin is for visually impaired people.

The proposed system is to build a customized application which acts as a voice assistant and can be used to help the visually impaired to access the most important features of their mobile phones. The app consists of four modules. These are:


1)Messaging Inbox – In this module the system will speak the new messages for the user and the user can also send messages through Speech Recognition API and text-to-speech API.

2)Phone Manager – In this module the user can either use the provided dialer or can speak recipient’s phone number to make a call.

3)Time/Date and Battery Status – In this module the user can get the phone’s current battery status and also know date and time.

4)Camera – This module will be used to identify Indian currency denomination and predict the notes scanned by the camera.
